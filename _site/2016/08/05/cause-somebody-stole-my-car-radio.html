    <p>Ok so this post is a lot less serious than the last one because I haven’t had anything bother me to that extent since I wrote it. And I haven’t thought that in-depth about one topic in particular since then either. Why? ‘Cause somebody stole my car radio and now I just sit in silence.</p>

<p>Well not really (also, listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92XVwY54h5k">this</a> song please if you don’t understand that reference). I don’t sit in silence in my car- I’ve been listening to podcasts. Like <em>a lot</em> of podcasts. I’ve been doing a lot of driving recently: my work is 30+ minutes away, I visited Penn State (~3 hrs) and Notre Dame (~6 hrs), my lake house is 2+ hours away, etc. So there’s lots of opportunities for podcasts, and there’s lots of opportunities to think about those topics.</p>

<p>So basically, I’m going to briefly talk about some of my favorite podcasts and some of the cool things I’ve learned that I’ll probably write longer posts on later.</p>

<p><strong>Revisionist History</strong></p>

<p>Okay, if you’ve never heard of Malcolm Gladwell, please do yourself a favor and listen to this podcast. Or read one of his <em>many</em> super famous books (ever heard of <em>Outliers</em> or <em>Blink</em> or <em>The Tipping Point</em> or <em>David and Goliath</em>?).</p>

<p>Seriously though, this guy is a genius. I wish I could be his personal assistant. He has such a way with words and an incredible gift of being able to simplify difficult concepts in a way that every person can understand. And he’s fun and quirky and his voice keeps you interested during a six hour drive.</p>

<p>There isn’t a podcast in Revisionist History that I haven’t enjoyed. I did particularly enjoy his “mini-series” on education: in essence, it focused on why there are so many poor, smart kids in this country and what we can do as a society to reduce this number.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can listen to all of Gladwell’s episodes on the <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/">Revisionist History website</a> if you’re still curious. Maybe I’ll try and simplify some concept like Gladwell does someday.</p>

<p><strong>TED Radio Hour</strong></p>

<p>I’ve always loved TED talks but it’s so hard to find time to listen to them when you’re swamped at school and don’t have a free hour. Well TED Radio Hour helped solve this problem of mine by combining little bits of a bunch of related TED talks together and presenting them with that common theme in mind. It’s awesome.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites have been <em>What Makes Us … Us</em>, <em>Open Source World</em>, and <em>Screen Time</em>. I might write more on those second two: I absolutely love the concept of open source and how that episode explored how you can take open source beyond just computing, and I also love looking at how technology impacts humanity like the <em>Screen Time</em> episodes did.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in listening to these as well, you can check them out on the <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/">NPR website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Stuff You Should Know</strong></p>

<p>I don’t love this podcast as much as the two above, mainly just because of the style of it- it’s slower and the hosts tend to go off on tangents when I just want to hear the information itself. <em>But</em> they did have this one super random episode that I loved, and I’m still searching for more like it.</p>

<p>This episode was <em>Why Are So Many Disembodied Feet Washing Ashore in British Columbia?</em> and it was seriously weird. Not gross, I promise, just quirky and weird and truly fascinating. I won’t spoil the answer to the question for you, but you can give it a listen for yourself on their <a href="http://www.stuffyoushouldknow.com/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Okay well I think I’m done. If you read this far, thanks for putting up with my ramblings. Hopefully I’ll have a more solidified idea to talk about in my next post.</p>

<p><strong>PEACE</strong></p>

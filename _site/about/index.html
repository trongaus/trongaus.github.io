</p>

<p>My name is Taylor Rongaus, and I’m a rising junior at the <strong>University of Notre Dame</strong>. Originally, I’m from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but Notre Dame has <em>truly</em> become my new home.</p>

<p>At Notre Dame, I’m majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong>; minoring in <strong>Science, Technology, and Values</strong>; and persuing a minor in <strong>Engineering Corporate Practice</strong>. I often get asked: “<em>What do you plan on doing with that?</em>” and my honest answer is “<em>I don’t know.</em>” As of right now, my interests lie in studying the ways that humans interact with technology and attempting to bridge the gap between the technical and the non-technical. I hope, though, that by providing myself an education in a technical field with an extensive liberal arts background, I will begin to understand this gap.</p>

<p>While at school, I hold a job as an <strong>Undergraduate Student Assistant</strong> for the <strong>Introduction to Engineering I/II</strong> courses. This requires me to attend classes, hold office hours, grade homework, and generally be familiar with the concepts and softwares taught in the class (i.e., LabVIEW and MATLAB). This summer, I will be <strong>interning with the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory</strong> located in West Mifflin, PA underneath of their Knowledge and Multimedia Services team. Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory is a U.S. Government-owned research and development facility operated by Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation.</p>

<p>I also have a variety of other interests in life, including:</p>

<h4 id="event-planning"><strong>Event Planning</strong></h4>
<p>At school, I am one of the Co-Captains for my dorm’s Freshman Orientation. This means that I, and my Co-Captain, are in charge of picking and managing a team of 17 ambassadors below us, moving in ~100 First-Year girls to our dorm, planning events for these girls within our dorm, and planning events for these girls to interact with a variety of other First-Years and their dorms. Planning these 10 or so specific events starts months in advance and requires much coordination and organization on our parts, but it is one of my <em>favorite</em> activities.</p>

<h4 id="music"><strong>Music</strong></h4>
<p>I really enjoy keeping up with new (and old!) music, and I do a radio show with friends at Notre Dame where we play some of our favorites (you can check it out on <a href="https://wvfi.nd.edu">WVFI</a> but the date/ time of our show next semester is TBD). My current obsessions are Rihanna’s album ANTI; Amy Winehouse’s album Back to Black; and just about anything by BORNS, KYGO, Twenty-One Pilots, Florence and the Machine, or Adele.</p>

<h4 id="organization"><strong>Organization</strong></h4>
<p>A weird interest, I know, but there’s something so satisfying to me about being organized in everything you do. My <a href="https://pinterest.com/trongaus">Pinterest page</a> is probably the best digital example of my organized “life” (a very inaccurate representation of my life, though: if only I had the money to afford to buy and do all of my dreams on that page!).</p>

<h4 id="travel"><strong>Travel</strong></h4>
<p>Another thing I would do more if I could! I, like most people, truly do want to see the world. Last summer, I spent six weeks studying abroad at Notre Dame’s campus in London, England, and during my time there I took trips to see Cinque Terre and Florence, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; and Paris, France. It undoubtedly was the best six weeks of my life, and I hope to be able to go back to London someday soon. I also like to travel around a little closer to home: I’ve visited around 18 of the 50 states, Canada, Mexico, Aruba, St. Thomas, St. Maarten, and the Dominican Republic! Seeing new places is something I will forever enjoy. I also like to document some of my expenditures on my <a href="https://vsco.co/trongaus">VSCO page</a>, so feel free to check that out as well!</p>

<h4 id="reading"><strong>Reading</strong></h4>
<p>Not the most common interest of a Computer Scientist! My favorite author is Agatha Christie (I couldn’t even put a number on how much I’ve read by her), and I love old novels in general. I also enjoy reading books by Malcolm Gladwell, Dan Brown, J.K. Rowling/ Robert Galbraith, and many many more.</p>

<p>Thanks for finding your way to my website!</p>

<p>My name is Taylor Rongaus, and I’m a rising junior Computer Science Major at the University of Notre Dame. Originally, I’m from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but Notre Dame has truly become my new home.</p>

<p>Check out my <a href="http://trongaus.github.io/about">About</a> page for more about me, the projects I have completed in my courses at Notre Dame on my <a href="http://trongaus.github.io/projects">Projects</a> page, or my other blog posts on the <a href="http://trongaus.github.io">Home</a> page!</p>

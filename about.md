My name is Taylor Rongaus, and I'm a rising junior Computer Science Major at the University of Notre Dame. Originally, I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but Notre Dame has truly become my new home.

At Notre Dame, I'm majoring in Computer Science; minoring in Science, Technology, and Values; and persuing a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I often get asked: "What do you plan on doing with that?" and my answer is honestly "I don't know". As of right now, my interests lie in studying the ways that humans interact with technology and attempting to bridge the gap between the technical and the non-technical. I hope, though, that by providing myself an education in a technical field with a liberal arts background, I will be able to help understand this gap.

I also have a variety of other, more random, interests in life, including:

* Event Planning
* Music
* Organization
* Travel
* Shows

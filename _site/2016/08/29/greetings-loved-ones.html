    <p>I think I’ve officially decided to name all future posts after random song lyrics.</p>

<p>Anyway, greetings loved ones. It’s been a little while. I’ve realized it’s hard to make time to write blog posts when I’m busy at school. So I’ve decided to talk more about what’s keeping me busy at school, because I clearly think it’s interesting so maybe you will too. <em>Let’s take a journey</em>.</p>

<p>So I moved back into my dorm (Lewis Hall, home of a chicken) almost two weeks ago. I then spent the first week planning events for and orienting the new freshmen chicks to the community of Lewis. It was wonderful and magical and I’ve never felt more rewarded. I might have shed a few rare tears. But I’m so excited to foster relationships with these women and am so blessed to have been the first face that welcomed them into our beautiful community here.</p>

<p>Oh also, I lost my voice. Pretty badly. I sounded like a man for about a week and only am now able to sing (in a very low pitch, mind you) again. I just had so much excitement for that first week that I was in the process of losing my voice before the girls even showed up that Friday… whoops.</p>

<p>Following that week was syllabus week here, and I found out just how much I <em>loved</em> my classes this semester! I’ll be taking <strong>Data Structures</strong>, <strong>Computer Architecture</strong>, <strong>Human Computer Interaction</strong>, <strong>Integrated Engineering &amp; Business Fundamentals</strong>, and <strong>Introduction to Design Thinking</strong>. I’m really excited about this mainly because I think I have an idea of what I want to do with my life now. Details to come though- I haven’t worked out the full idea yet. I’ll just tell you that I love the Human Computer Interaction class the most.</p>

<p>And now we’re in the present. I’m preparing for career fairs and updating my resume and applying for internships and trying to get my homework schedule and work schedule for the semester all sorted out. It’s a crazy time. I’m hoping that I can line something up for this summer soon, though, so I can really focus on these classes that I’m so excited for! Ah!</p>

<p>Hopefully I can write more soon- I’ve actually started enjoying writing these completely random blogs about whatever obscure thing is on my mind at the moment. I’m pretty sure nobody reads them, and that’s fine with me. I even took off the default “Subscribe” options and “View Count” options from the website originally because I enjoy that anonymity. So, loyal reader, thanks for hanging in there for so long. One day I’ll make it big with this blog and you can say you knew me when.</p>

<p><strong>PEACE</strong></p>

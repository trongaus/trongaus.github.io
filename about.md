Welcome to my blog! If you've clicked on this page, it's likely because you have no idea what's going on here.

I'm a firm believer in the fact that a resume doesn't allow you to get to know a person. This website is my way of resolving that problem: it's a mixture of my personal interests, my quirks, things that are of interest to me, and that important professional information that an employer still wants and needs to know.

Check out my [Me][trongaus-Me] page for more about me personally, the projects I have completed in my courses at Notre Dame on my [Projects][trongaus-Projects] page, or my random blog posts on the [Home][trongaus-Home] page!

Enjoy!

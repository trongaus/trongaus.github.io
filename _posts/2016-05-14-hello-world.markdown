Thanks for finding your way to my website!

My name is Taylor Rongaus, and I'm a rising junior Computer Science Major at the University of Notre Dame. Originally, I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but Notre Dame has truly become my new home.

Check out my [About][trongaus-About] page for more about me, the projects I have completed in my courses at Notre Dame on my [Projects][trongaus-Projects] page, or my other blog posts on the [Home][trongaus-Home] page!

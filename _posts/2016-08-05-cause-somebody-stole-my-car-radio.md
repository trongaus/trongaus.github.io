Ever heard [this][Car Radio] by Twenty One Pilots before? As much as I don't want to say that I like the song... I still like the song. Twenty One Pilots was one of my first ever favorite bands and they get a lot of hate and it makes me sad. That's a topic of its own. But anyway...

If you don't understand the title reference, please listen to the song first. And know that I don't sit in silence in my car- I've been listening to podcasts. Like *a lot* of podcasts. I've been doing a lot of driving recently: my work is 30+ minutes away, I visited Penn State (~3 hrs) and Notre Dame (~6 hrs), my lake house is 2+ hours away, etc. So there's lots of opportunities for podcasts, and there's lots of opportunities to think about those topics.

So basically, I'm going to briefly talk about some of my favorite podcasts and some of the cool things I've learned that I'll probably write longer posts on later.


**Revisionist History**

Okay, if you've never heard of Malcolm Gladwell, please do yourself a favor and listen to this podcast. Or read one of his *many* super famous books (ever heard of *Outliers* or *Blink* or *The Tipping Point* or *David and Goliath*?). 

Seriously though, this guy is a genius. I wish I could be his personal assistant. He has such a way with words and an incredible gift of being able to simplify difficult concepts in a way that every person can understand. And he's fun and quirky and his voice keeps you interested during a six hour drive.

There isn't a podcast in Revisionist History that I haven't enjoyed. I did particularly enjoy his "mini-series" on education: in essence, it focused on why there are so many poor, smart kids in this country and what we can do as a society to reduce this number.

Anyway, you can listen to all of Gladwell's episodes on the [Revisionist History website][RH] if you're still curious. Maybe I'll try and simplify some concept like Gladwell does someday.


**TED Radio Hour**

I've always loved TED talks but it's so hard to find time to listen to them when you're swamped at school and don't have a free hour. Well TED Radio Hour helped solve this problem of mine by combining little bits of a bunch of related TED talks together and presenting them with that common theme in mind. It's awesome. 

Some of my favorites have been *What Makes Us ... Us*, *Open Source World*, and *Screen Time*. I might write more on those second two: I absolutely love the concept of open source and how that episode explored how you can take open source beyond just computing, and I also love looking at how technology impacts humanity like the *Screen Time* episodes did.

If you're interested in listening to these as well, you can check them out on the [NPR website][TED].


**Stuff You Should Know**

I don't love this podcast as much as the two above, mainly just because of the style of it- it's slower and the hosts tend to go off on tangents when I just want to hear the information itself. *But* they did have this one super random episode that I loved, and I'm still searching for more like it. 

This episode was *Why Are So Many Disembodied Feet Washing Ashore in British Columbia?* and it was seriously weird. Not gross, I promise, just quirky and weird and truly fascinating. I won't spoil the answer to the question for you, but you can give it a listen for yourself on their [website][SYSK].


Okay well I think I'm done. If you read this far, thanks for putting up with my ramblings. Hopefully I'll have a more solidified idea to talk about in my next post.


**PEACE**

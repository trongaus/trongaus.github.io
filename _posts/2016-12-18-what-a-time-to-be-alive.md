I'm a terrible blogger.

Anyways. Hello. It's been an entire semester since you've heard from me. Are you wondering what's new in my life? Probably not. But I'm going to tell you anyway in the form of this fun timeline.

**August**

Moved into college

Ran Lewis Hall's Welcome Weekend which was a whole bundle of stress wrapped up in fun
<br>
Started classes and thought they would all be fun (haha good one Taylor)

*cries about friends leaving to go abroad and having to go home*
<br>
Drove through a winter storm to get home for break
<br>
Sat on my couch and wrote this post

<br>

So here we are, 5/8 of the way through my college career. What a semester it has been. In all honesty, it probably was my favorite semester of all. School and internship applications were a lot, but I freed up my schedule so I could focus on them both and still have time to live in my awesome dorm with my awesome friends.

**Here's to 2017!**

(note to self: New Year's Resolution is to be a better blogger)

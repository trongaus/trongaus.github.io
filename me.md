My name is Taylor Rongaus, and I'm a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. Originally, I'm from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, but Notre Dame has become my new home.

At Notre Dame, I'm majoring in Computer Science and pursuing a minor in Engineering Corporate Practice. I often get asked: "What do you plan on doing with that?" and my honest answer is "I don't know." As of right now, my interests lie in studying the ways that humans interact with technology and attempting to bridge the gap between the technical and the non-technical. I hope that by providing myself an education in a technical field with an extensive liberal arts background, I will begin to understand this gap.

While at school, I hold a job as an Undergraduate Student Assistant for the Introduction to Engineering Systems and Processes course. This requires me to attend classes, hold office hours, grade homework, and generally be familiar with the concepts and softwares taught in the class. This past summer, I interned here in Pittsburgh with Naval Nuclear Laboratory, a U.S. Government-owned research and development facility operated by Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corporation. This coming summer, I will be working with Ernst & Young's Technology Advisory Program in New York, New York.

## **My Interests** ##

#### **Event Planning** ####
At school, I was one of the Co-Captains for my dorm's Freshman Orientation. This meant that I, and my Co-Captain, were in charge of picking and managing a team of 17 ambassadors below us, moving in ~100 First-Year girls to our dorm, planning events for these girls within our dorm, and planning events for these girls to interact with a variety of other First-Years and their dorms. Planning these 10 or so specific events starts months in advance and requires much coordination and organization on our parts, but it is one of my favorite activities.


#### **Music** ####
I really enjoy keeping up with new music, and I do a radio show with friends at Notre Dame where we play some of our favorites (you can check it out on [WVFI][radioshow] and follow our show on [Twitter][darttime] to get the updates about when we'll be on the air). My most recent obsessions are Bon Iver's album "22, A Million," Rihanna's album "ANTI," and Glass Animals' album "How To Be A Human Being."


#### **Organization** ####
There's just something so satisfying to me about being organized in everything you do. My [Pinterest][trongaus-pinterest] page is probably the best digital example of my organized "life" (a very inaccurate representation of my life, though: if only I had the money to afford to buy and do all of my dreams on that page). 


#### **Travel** ####
Over the summer of 2015, I spent six weeks studying abroad at Notre Dame's campus in London, England. During my time there I took trips to see Cinque Terre and Florence, Italy; Barcelona, Spain; and Paris, France. It undoubtedly was the best six weeks of my life, and I hope to be able to go back to London someday soon. I also like to travel around a little closer to home: I've visited around 18 of the 50 states, Canada, Mexico, Aruba, St. Thomas, St. Maarten, and the Dominican Republic! Seeing new places is something I will forever enjoy. I also like to document some of my adventures on my [VSCO][trongaus-vsco] page, so feel free to check that out as well!


#### **Reading** ####
My favorite author is Agatha Christie (I couldn't even put a number on how much I've read by her), and I love old novels in general. I also enjoy reading books by Malcolm Gladwell, Dan Brown, J.K. Rowling/ Robert Galbraith, and many many more.

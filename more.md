Welcome to my blog! If you've clicked on this page, it's likely because you have no idea what's going on here.

I'm a firm believer in the fact that a resume doesn't allow you to get to know a person. This website is my way of resolving that problem: it's a mixture of my personal interests, my quirks, things that are of interest to me, and that important professional information that an employer still needs to know.

Check out my [About][trongaus-About] page for more about me, the projects I have completed in my courses at Notre Dame on my [Projects][trongaus-Projects] page, or my random blog posts on the [Home][trongaus-Home] page!

Enjoy!

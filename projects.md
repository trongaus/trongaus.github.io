#### **Casino** ####
My most recent group project was an open-ended, C++ based Casino. We were instructed to simply utilize concepts of C++ and OOP to create a functional project of some sort, so my group members and I chose to make a terminal-based Casino with multiple nested mini-games within it. The user enters their name upon entering the Casino, and the program will either give a new player starting money or determine how much money is in their wallet (if they have played the game before). It will then present the list of games that the user can have the choice to play: roulette, blackjack, five-card stud, slots, and keno. Each group member was in charge of the logic behind one game in particular (mine was roulette). A second group member and myself also took on the responsibility of linking all of the game classes together using composition to control the flow of money, and I personally also added in a lot of ASCII art and other fun features in order to maintain a **fun and smooth gameplay**.

I personally *loved* the result of this project. While many students choose to implement an SDL graphics-based game in C++, our group decided to do something different, yet still **fun and challenging**. There were no bugs in our code, and we worked together extremely well to create our final product. The **code** for this project **is available in Bitbucket** under the CSE20212_project repository's FINAL directory.

#### **Textbook Chapter** ####
This was a different, also recent, project of mine that I completed for an anthropology course entitled Hacking Life. This course was taken to satisfy a requirement for my Science, Technology, and Values minor, and I truly grew to regard it as **one of the best courses I have taken** thus far at Notre Dame. 

For those interested, the description of the course was as follows: 

"Everything is hacked. For good and bad, hacking has spread into every aspect of life - life-saving medical technology, social infrastructure, financial systems, biological processes, even personhood. This is both the front of profound creativity and dangerous global insecurity. It is the great equalizer: everyone has access to the technologies; everyone can be a target. And simultaneously it's disequilibrium: creating new haves and have-nots in politics, economics, and social capital. Studies show ELSI - ethical, legal, and social implications - are barely understood, with technology outpacing controls in all these areas. Completely new forms of power, criminality, science, society, and self are emerging. We, the proverbial anyone, are the battlegrounds for power and the source of solutions."

Throughout the semester, I worked with a group on a textbook that we would (in theory) be able to present to a future class, since there is really no concise literature on such a topic. We chose to write *Digital Realities*, which was our attempt at a discussion on the current state of technology in our society. I specifically chose to focus my chapter on the **Ethics** of technology, both in its usage and development, in such a society. This is a topic that I have recently had a fascination with, and it was very interesting to me to read the thoughts of some big names on the idea. If you're interested, you may download my chapter on the topic [here](https://github.com/trongaus/trongaus.github.io/raw/master/_includes/Ethics%20chapter%20of%20Digital%20Realities.pdf).



#### **Why Did The Chicken...?** ####

My partner group project from my sophomore fall semester was another open-ended one, this time based in C. We decided to put our own spin on the more well-known games of Crossy Road and Frogger by creating "Why Did The Chicken...?". This game utilizes a gfx library, created and maintained by the Notre Dame Computer Science department, for its graphics component and our own C-code for the movement and collision detection aspects.

Overall, this project was a *bit* of a struggle for two people, but we did eventually get a working final product. We spent more time on the graphics component than on the collision detection, which in hindsight was a mistake, considering the fact that our collision detection was not as accurate as we would have liked. With more time, I'm *sure* we would have been able to fix this problem, but it was a **good learning experience** for us regardless of the outcome. The **code** for this project **is available in Bitbucket** under the CSE20211 repository's finalproject directory.

#### **Battleship** ####
For my First-Year Engineering course's Open-Ended Project (the same course that I now work for!), my group chose to fully focus on our training in MATLAB by programming the game Battleship. Our overall goal was to develop a functional version of the game Battleship using MATLAB code by utilizing both user input and self-written functions to determine the moves of a human player against a computer opponent. The game would center around the creation of various GUIs for the user to dictate moves and decisions, view the game board, and graphically represent the results of computer gameplay. We wanted to provide an experience for the user that was smooth, accessible, and most of all, enjoyable. Below are screen captures of a flowchart showing the logic of the various created functions that provided the basis for the game, along with the three GUIs created for the project.

Overall, our project turned out to be *very* successful. Each computer algorithm (which I, personally, was in charge of creating) functioned properly, and the superior algorithm performed as expected in comparison to the lesser, as shown in the analysis GUI above. Also, the various functions that we created accurately represented the gameplay, providing a **smooth and enjoyable user experience**. My group put in *many* long hours of hard work to create such a result, and to this day I am very proud of my group's accomplishments on this project!

Another project for the First-Year Engineering course was to design a "Robotic Pet" for young children using LEGO NXT and LabVIEW Software. After discussing with the children what they would want in such a pet, my group created Spongebob Robotpants. Spongebob had five distinct features: he could move around while avoiding objects, perform karate, play the show's theme song when his nose was pressed, engage the user in a number guessing game, and go to sleep when the lights were turned off. A lot of trial and error and reworking went into creating our final design, and while our finished product was not necessarily the *most* exciting toy, it worked **consistently** and **accurately** leading up to and during our presentation. Overall, our group worked extremely well together and we played to everyone's strengths to make our design as robust and effective as possible. Pictured above is the final product of Spongebob Robotpants.

The third project for the First-Year Engineering course was a Platform Design project. While this doesn't pertain much to my interests today, it does go to show how I worked well with a group on a project that I didn't particularly enjoy. My group created a subassembly consisting of four small rectangular prisms, four longer rectangular prisms, four small cylinders, and four longer cylinders. The intended effect of stacking the floats with the longer floats on the bottom of the platform was to meet a 70% constraint, where the platform was not permitted to sink more than 70% between the nominal and limit loading conditions. Through this method, the platform sank deeper on the longer floats than on the shorter floats with larger surface areas, satisfying the constraint. Overall, our platform **performed close to expected** when we tested it in water with the weights for each loading condition. We came closer to the 70% constraint than expected, with an experimental difference in height displaced of 67%. However, our platform **held more weight than we predicted** and *ultimately succeeded* in our testing. Pictured above is my group's completed platform, upright (left) and upside-down (right).
